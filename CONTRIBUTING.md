## How to contribute to React Changelog

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/boxgames1/react-changelog/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/boxgames1/react-changelog/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, please detail the problem and bug reproduction.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in an issue and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

React Changelog is a volunteer effort and a work in progress so every colaboration and positive feedback is more than welcome.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
